The second Indian Association for General Relativity and Gravitation (IAGRG) school on Gravitation and Cosmology was organised by
International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS) at ICTS, India from 09 October 2023 to 20 October 2023. In this school, the emphasis 
was on cutting-edge topics on the physics of compact objects, both theoretical and observational. We have learned four contemporary 
topics taught by the leading experts. These topics are:
<ul>
  <li>Wald's covariant phase space formalism (Sudipta Sarkar, IIT Gandhinagar)</li>
  <li>Neutron star perturbation theory (Nils Andersson, University of Southampton)</li>
  <li>Black holes in General Relativity and beyond (Thomas Sotiriou, University of Nottingham)</li>
  <li>Dynamical horizons and their application (Badri Krishnan, Radboud University)</li>
</ul>
