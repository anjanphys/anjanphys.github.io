Beyond the Horizon: Testing the black hole paradigm is a school organised by ICTS-TIFR Bengaluru from March 24 - April 4, 2025.
This school emphasised the physics of black hole mimickers and ultra-compact objects in the context of both EHT
and LVK observations. The first week was devoted to observing the shadow of compact objects by the EHT collaboration 
and its consequences. In the second week, we learned how gravitational wave observations can be used to test the nature of central 
compact objects and possible environmental effects on black holes.
