It was a four-day academic visit to the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Kolkata, from May 19 to May 23, 2025. 
The visit was hosted by Professor Sumanta Chakraborty. During the visit, I presented my recent work on regular spacetimes and engaged in
several fruitful discussions on current research topics. We also explored the possibility of future collaboration.
