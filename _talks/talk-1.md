**Title**: *New regular black holes: geometry, matter sources, and shadow profiles*  
<br>

A new two-parameter, static, and spherically symmetric regular black hole geometry is proposed which, for specific parameter values, is geodesically complete and nonsingular. Unlike most regular black holes that reduce to Schwarzschild spacetime in the singular limit, our solution approaches a singular, mutated Reissner–Nordström geometry for certain parameter choices.

The matter required to support this geometry within General Relativity violates the energy conditions, though not across the entire radial domain. Nevertheless, a viable matter source is constructed using a nonlinear magnetic monopole in a chosen formulation of nonlinear electrodynamics. An alternative realization within braneworld gravity is also suggested.

We further compute the shadow profile of this black hole and explore how recent observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration can constrain the model parameters.
