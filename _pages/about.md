### Welcome to Anjan's Page

Since July 2022, I have been a PhD student at the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of
Technology, Kharagpur, India. I work under the supervision of
[Prof. Sayan Kar](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1003662?ui-citation-summary=true).

My research focuses on strong-field gravity and the observable signatures of compact objects. 
I study black holes and wormholes beyond the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, with particular
emphasis on regular black holes constructed using nonlinear electrodynamics and effective matter models. 
I have analysed their geometric properties and electromagnetic observables, including black hole shadow 
characteristics and comparisons with Event Horizon Telescope observations.

More recently, my work has shifted toward gravitational-wave modelling of extreme mass-ratio inspiral systems,
with a strong emphasis on self-force effects in orbital evolution and waveform generation, relevant for future 
space-based detectors such as LISA.

During my master’s studies, I worked on black hole shadows in static, spherically symmetric and stationary, 
axisymmetric spacetimes arising in alternative theories of gravity. 

I value open, collaborative, and reproducible research practices. Outside of research, I enjoy reading fiction,
gardening, and playing video games.
