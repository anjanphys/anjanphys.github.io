A rotating version of a known static, spherically symmetric, zero Ricci scalar Lorentzian wormhole is constructed. It turns out that for this given non-rotating geometry, the standard NewmanJanis algorithm does not produce a rotating wormhole and, therefore, the method pioneered by Azreg-A¨ınou has to be used. The rotating spacetime thus obtained is shown to be regular with wormhole features, though it is no longer a R = 0 spacetime. The required matter is found to violate the energy conditions, as expected. A few other characteristic properties of this new rotating spacetime are mentioned. Finally, we calculate the shadow for this geometry and discuss its features vis-a-vis the Kerr geometry and available EHT observations.
