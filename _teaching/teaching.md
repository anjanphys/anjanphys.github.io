My research is mostly on classical general relativity and some observational perspectives.

## Regular black holes

Understanding the end conclusion of gravitational collapse of initially stable structures requires solving the singularity problem in spacetime. Regular black holes are acknowledged as viable possibilities for non-singular solutions. The figure depicts a typical static, spherically symmetric, regular black hole. Regular black holes clearly replace the singularity point of vacuum BHs in Einstein's GR with a `regular core'. We concentrate on creating innovative regular black holes and studying their several features.



## Nonlinear electrodynamics
In Maxwell’s electrodynamics, a point charge's electric field and self-energy exhibit a divergence as the radial distance approaches zero. One of the well-known procedures to address this issue involves modifying Maxwell’s linear Lagrangian nonlinearly, which makes the self-energy of a point charge finite. However, we consider to what extent we can benefit from this process and whether eliminating spacetime singularities is eventually possible. We couple these nonlinear electrodynamic Lagrangians with general relativity and look for non-singular spacetime solutions.
