My research is mostly on classical general relativity and some observational perspectives.

## Regular black holes

Understanding the end conclusion of gravitational collapse of initially stable structures requires solving the singularity problem in spacetime. Regular black holes are acknowledged as viable possibilities for non-singular solutions. The figureÂ depicts a typical static, spherically symmetric, regular black hole. Regular black holes clearly replace the singularity point of vacuum BHs in Einstein's GR with a `regular core'. We concentrate on creating innovative regular black holes and studying their several features.



## Nonlinear electrodynamics
Description of the second topic goes here.
